            We help you meet your compliance and manage risk as per ADA, Section
            508 or Affordable Healthcare Act. We ensure that your documents are

            fully meets the accessibility standards and guidelines.

            Document accessibility can be complicated. Making sure an accessible
            document is actually usable by those with vision or cognitive
            disabilities can be even more complex. You need a trusted partner to
            help you navigate the sea of document accessibility requirements and
            regulations. We understands there is no one-size-fits-all solution
            when it comes to making a digital document accessible and usable for
            everyone. You can trust on our team to ensure your entire document
            library serves the needs of your customers while ensuring compliance
            with WCAG 2.1, PDF/UA, Section 508 and other state and federal
            standards.

            How many PDFs are available to customers to download from your
            website today? More to the point, how many of them comply with the
            applicable accessibility guidelines including WCAG 2.1, PDF/UA and
            Section 508? You canâ€™t afford to ignore these legacy PDFs. Just one
            complaint about a non-compliant document could lead to a lawsuit,
            fines and more.
