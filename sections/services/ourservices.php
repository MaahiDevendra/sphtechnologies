          Document accessibility can be complicated. Making sure an accessible
          document is actually usable by those with vision or cognitive
          disabilities can be even more complex. You need a trusted partner to
          help you navigate the sea of document accessibility requirements and
          regulations.

          PDFs also need to be accessible so that people with disabilities using
          screen reader, speech to text technology or braille displayer get
          equal access. Providing Accessible PDFs is now a requirement as per
          Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508 & AODA.

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
          Just because a document is available as a downloadable PDF does not
          mean that it is an accessible PDF. As we know, PDFs are the go to
          format for organizations to share information.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
          A document or application is considered accessible if meets certain
          technical criteria and can be used by people with disabilities. This
          includes access by people who are mobility impaired, blind, low
          vision, deaf, hard of hearing, or who have cognitive impairments.
          Accessibility features in Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader and in the
          Portable Document Format (PDF) make it easier for people with
          disabilities to use PDF documents and forms, with and without the aid
          of assistive technology software and devices such as screen readers,
          screen magnifiers, text-to-speech software, speech recognition
          software, alternative input devices, Braille embossers, and
          refreshable Braille displays.

          The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and the PDF/UA
          (ISO 14289-1) standard cover a wide range of recommendations for
          making content more accessible to people with disabilities. One
          benefit of following these guidelines is that content becomes more
          usable for all users. For example, the underlying document structure
          that makes it possible for a screen reader to properly read a PDF out
          loud also makes it possible for a mobile device to correctly reflow
          and display the document on a small screen. Similarly, the preset tab
          order of an accessible PDF form helps all users—not just users who
          rely on the keyboard—complete the form more easily

          Forms can be newsletter subscription, event registration, job
          application, customer feedback, admission forms, sign up forms etc.
          Most of the organization use PDF forms to collect and organize data.
          But it is important to make these forms accessible to gather data
          efficiently.

        <p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 100px" data-aos="fade-right">
          Making a PDF from accessible requires a little more effort as it is
          more than just dropping form elements into your document. PDF forms
          have some inherent accessibility limitations and hence it is important
          to provide a text description that will make the PDF fillable and help
          a screen reader to access the form easily while navigating through the
          PDF.
