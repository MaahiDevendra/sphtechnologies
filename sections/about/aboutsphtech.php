              Today digital documents have replaced paper!<br />
              The key word to focus on is replaced, so now we<br />
              need to ensure that each of these digital documents<br />
              & forms can be read, searched, completed independently<br />
              by everyone! Whether it is the user manual of the<br />
              mobile phone you just bought, that<br />
              textbook you wanted to study for your<br />
              economics course, the bank statement that you received,<br />
              or then a Student Enrollment<br />
              form at a University.
